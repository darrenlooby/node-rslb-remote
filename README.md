#Really Simple Load Balancer - Remote

This module is designed to signal [node-rslb](https://github.com/darrenlooby/node-rslb) - it automatiically adds and remove itself from the target list.

###Todo
1. Write basic documentation
2. Add function to manipulate the load balancer - so that the server can remove itself programactically. For example, under high load, or during a clean up sequence.
